The Technology Evaluation Framework (TEF) was developed by John Graybeal (@graybeal), as an [ESIP Testbed](http://testbed.esipfed.org/) project, to support the evaluation of NASA AIST software or technology products. The evaluation is based on NASA's [Technology Readiness Levels](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/txt_accordion1.html).

More information and files can be found on the Products & Services site, in the [01-19-2016 Telecon page](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/P%26S_Telecon_-_January_19,_2016#Technology_Evaluation_Framework_Final_Report).

**Development Branch**

Some work was done on a development version of the spreadsheet. The principle change was the existence of a set of Fitness questions, that the author was fond of. That spreadsheet can be downloaded from the Telecon page, or directly by using
