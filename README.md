The Technology Evaluation Framework (TEF) was developed by John Graybeal (@graybeal), as an [ESIP Testbed](http://testbed.esipfed.org/) project, to support the evaluation of NASA AIST software or technology products. The evaluation is based on NASA's [Technology Readiness Levels](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/txt_accordion1.html).
